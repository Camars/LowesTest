Node js https://nodejs.org

http-server https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server `npm install http-server -g`

If you have node you can clone this and just install http-server (above). Then you can cd into the dist folder and run `http-server`.

After running that it will give you a running server on your local machine. Copy one of the returned addresses and paste in a browser.

This will bring up the page I built.

That's it!

If you wish to make any changes or to use this for any reason, you may.

Clone it and do `npm install` and `bower install` (on the command line) to install the dependencies and there you go that should be it.

My process:

I built this page with Nodejs, npm, Yeoman, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Bower.

1. I used Node to start and keep everything together.
2. npm for getting packages and keeping them consistent (version wise).
3. Yeoman for the template generator (simple `webapp`).
4. jQuery for Ajax and simple element manipulation.
5. Bootstrap mainly for the grid also for a few classes.
6. Bower for package bundling and so cloning wouldn't be cumbersome.
