Node js https://nodejs.org

http-server https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server npm install http-server -g

If you have node you can clone this and just install http-server (above). Then you can cd into the dist folder and run http-server.

After running that it will give you a running server on your local machine. Copy one of the returned addresses and paste in a browser.

Once that loads you'll see the directory click on "/dist". This will bring up the page I built.

That's it!
